# LandPlotter

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/chandrasmailbox/LandPlotter)

The application should now start properly in offline mode. You can:

Use npm run web to start the web version
Use npm run android or npm run ios to start the mobile version
Use the default npm run start to choose your platform
Would you like to test a specific platform or should I explain any part of the setup in more detail?
